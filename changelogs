[19/07/2017] Torrench V1.2
1. Fixed comments fetch. It's possible to now fetch all the comments a torrent has. 	
NOTE:
	Comments are divided into pages. 1 page can have MAX 25 comments. 
	Now if a torrent has <=50 comments (2 pages), no prompt occurs.
	If a torrent has more than 50 comments, you will get a prompt asking number of pages to fetch.
	Options:
		(fetch all): Fetch all pages
		(enter n): Enter number of pages to fetch
		(d): "display anyway" - Do not fetch any extra pages. By default the latest comments (comments on last page) are fetched.	
Fetching comments pages can be time-costly. For every comment page, entire new HTML page is fetched.		
2. More verbose. Show proxy in use, time taken for fetch, colorify output, etc.
